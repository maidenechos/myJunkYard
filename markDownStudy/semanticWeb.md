# Semantic Web #

## The Web of Data ##

###Generation of Internet ###
By the Internet has evolved we can classify it into these generations.

*  First Generation : **Computer Centered Processing**

    So how do you get information in this generation?
    * Open Terminal and connect to a remote computer by some IP.
    * Retrieve file system on that machine from current computer.
    * Download the file from the remote machine to your machine.
    * Read file in your local machine.
    
    Problems
    * Information Access requires expert knowledge.
    * Information Access is expensive.
    * Information retrieval is very expensive. 

*   Second Generation: **Document Centered Processing**
    
    So how do you get information in this generation?
    * Open Browser
    * Load Document.
    * click on a hypertext and continue.
    
    Advantages
    * No expert knowledge required.
    * Simple Information Access
    * Information retrieval through search engine

### The Limits of Web ###
In todays day, we find information in www by the use of search engine's like

* Google
* Bing
* Yahoo etc.

Now the real problem is that, the web is huge really huge, so these search engines cannot really reach the end of *World Wide Web* Universe. 

This huge amount of data is created by humans as of now, but in future with *Internet of things* coming into picture there will be real **things** creating information in this World wide web.

Now the real problem with these information generated, for a machine and sometime human is

* How to know what is *important* on the web.
* What is this information?
* What does this information *mean*.
* How *Credible/trustworthy* is the information?
* What information belongs together?
* What is redundant?

Now humans have some contextual knowledge, world knowledge and experience to solve the problem by *things* or *machines* does not have this capacity.
Also the Web is supposed to used by humans, as a reason.

* The web is based on the markup language HTML

Now **HTML** describes 

* how the information is *presented*
* how the information is *linked*
* but not, what the information means.

### Importance of Meaning ###
Since we are not able to find out what information means, and since HTML in there very nature have no way to convey this information.

So before we work towards finding out how to find the meaning we should be equipped with some know-how of these.

#### Header Text ####
  *Syntax**

**Syntax** means *arrangement*, as in **rules** which help in constructing a sentence in a language like,

* In **formal languages**, syntax is just set of rules, by which well formed expressions can be created from a fundamental set of symbols (alphabet).
* In **computer science**, syntax defines the normative structure of Data.

Syntax tells how to make a valid sentences in a particular languages, whereas semantics tells us the meaning of the sentence formed by the syntax.

-----

* **Semantics** 

Semantics is the part of linguistics focused on 

* **Sense**
* **Meaning**

of languages or symbols of languages.

Semantics asks, how **sense** and **meaning** of complex concepts can be derived from simple concepts based on the rules of **syntax**.

The Semantics of a message depends on its **context** and **pragmatics.**
