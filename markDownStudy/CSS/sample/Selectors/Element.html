    You know how the characters in 
    <cite>Harry Potter</cite> are always banging
    on about "muggles", and how we're all so 
    inadequate that we have to use things like 
    "technology", to make up for not having magic..?
  </p>
  <p>
    Well, wouldn't it be funny if it turned out 
    that "magic" is actually <strong>heuristic 
    nano-technology</strong>, sent back in time 
    from the distant future to the middle-ages, 
    and originally invented by <strong>us</strong>! 
  </p>
  <p>
    It'd be like, <q>Ha! Who's the muggles now!</q>
