	<h1>Waffles!</h1>
	<p style="color: gray;">The most wonderful of all breakfast foods is
	the waffleâ€”a ridged and cratered slab of home-cooked, fluffy goodness
	that makes every child's heart soar with joy. And they're so easy to make!
	Just a simple waffle-maker and some batter, and you're ready for a morning
	of aromatic ecstasy!
	</p>
