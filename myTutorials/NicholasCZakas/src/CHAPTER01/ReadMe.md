# What Is JavaScript?

* JavaScript first appeared in 1995, to handle some of the input validation that use to go all the way to the server previously.
* Now Javascript is no longer only used for input validation, it used to interact with nearly all aspects of the browser window and its contents.

## [A SHORT HISTORY](#head1234)

* **Brendan Eich**, who worked for Netscape at the time, began developing a scripting language called Mocha, and later LiveScript, for the release of Netscape Navigator 2 in 1995.
* The intention of using it both in the browser and on the server (where it was to be called LiveWire).
* Netscape changed LiveScript's name to JavaScript to capitalize on the buzz that Java was receiving from the press, as it was into a development alliance with Sun MicroSystem.
* Microsoft introduced Internet Explorer 3 with a JavaScript implementation called JScript (so called to avoid any possible licensing issues with Netscape).
* Microsoft's implementation of JavaScript meant that there were two different JavaScript versions floating around: 
  * JavaScript in Netscape Navigator and 
  * JScript in Internet Explorer.
* In 1997, JavaScript 1.1 was submitted to the European Computer Manufacturers Association (Ecma) as a proposal.
* Since that time, browsers have tried, with varying degrees of success, to use ECMAScript as a basis for their JavaScript implementations.

## JAVASCRIPT IMPLEMENTATIONS

Though JavaScript and ECMAScript are often used synonymously, JavaScript is much more than just what is defined in ECMA-262.

A complete JavaScript implementation is made up of the following three distinct parts.

1. The Core (ECMAScript)
2. The Document Object Model (DOM)
3. The Browser Object Model (BOM)

### ECMAScript

* ECMAScript, the language defined in ECMA-262, isn't tied to web browsers.
* ECMAScript at a very basic level describe the following parts of the language.
  * Syntax
  * Types
  * Statements
  * Keywords
  * Reserved words
  * Operators
  * Objects
* JavaScript implements ECMAScript, but so does Adobe ActionScript.

#### ECMAScript Editions

* The different versions of ECMAScript are defi ned as **editions.**
* The most recent edition of ECMA-262 is edition 5, released in 2009.
* The first edition of ECMA-262 was essentially the
