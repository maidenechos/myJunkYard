# Chapter 01: What is JavaScript #
---

* JavaScript first appeared in the year of 1995,
* With the purpose of handling input validation in client side.
* Present day JavaScript is not bounded by just input validation.
* JavaScript is a language which takes just days to learn but years to master.

## A short history ##
* **Brendan Erich** who worked in NetScape, started working on a scripting language called **Mocha**, and later **LiveWire**, with the intension of using it both on the client and server.
* Netscape entered into a development alliance with **Sun MicroSystem** to complete the implementation of LiveScript in time for the release of NetScape.NetScape changed the name to **JavaScript**, to ride on the buzz created by **Java**.
* As JavaScript became popular and NetScape was on its way to become a market Leader, **Microsoft** launched its own browser called **Internet Explorer**, with a JavaScript implementation called as **JScript** to avoid any license issue with Netscape.
* Microsoft implementation of JavaScript meant that there were two versions of different JavaScipit being used.
    - JavaScript in NetScape.
    - JScript in Internet Explorer.
* Unlike *C*, JavaScript had no standard governing its syntax and features.
* In 1997, JavaScript 1.1 was submitted to **ECMA**,
